# Alchemy-ColorShaper
Create color palettes based on images! You can edit the parameters to get the most satisfying effect!
When you generate a palette, you can change four parameters:
- Threshold - threshold of filter operation, whose task is to remove colors that are too similar to each other,
- Resolution - resolution to which the image should be scaled for faster analysis,
- Compression - the compression force expressed in the number of pixels that are the component of the pseudo-pixel,
- Accuracy - Leap during image analysis.
